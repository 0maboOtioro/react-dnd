 The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton: A Review     
The Luminaries is a 2013 novel by Eleanor Catton, a New Zealand author who won the Booker Prize for this work. The novel is set in the 1860s, during the gold rush in the South Island of New Zealand. It follows the intertwined fates of a large cast of characters, whose stories are revealed through a complex astrological structure. The novel is a mystery, a historical fiction, and a metafiction, exploring the nature of storytelling and the role of fate and free will.
     
## Plot Summary
     
The novel begins with Walter Moody, a young British lawyer who arrives in Hokitika, a coastal town on the west coast of New Zealand, in 1866. He stumbles into a secret meeting of twelve men at the Crown Hotel, who are discussing a series of mysterious events that have occurred in the town. These events include the death of a hermit named Crosbie Wells, who was found with a fortune in gold in his cabin; the disappearance of a young and wealthy prospector named Emery Staines; the attempted suicide of a prostitute named Anna Wetherell; and the arrest of a Maori greenstone hunter named Te Rau Tauwhare for the murder of a Chinese opium dealer named Quee Long.

The twelve men, who represent different professions and backgrounds, each have a connection to these events and to each other. They are: Charlie Frost, a banker; Edgar Clinch, an hotelier; Benjamin Lowenthal, a newspaperman; Cowell Devlin, a chaplain; Sook Yongsheng, a hatter; Aubert Gascoigne, a justice's clerk; Joseph Pritchard, a chemist; Thomas Balfour, a shipping agent; Harald Nilssen, a commission merchant; Dick Mannering, a goldfields magnate; Quee Long, the deceased opium dealer; and Te Rau Tauwhare, the accused greenstone hunter. They tell Moody their stories and perspectives, hoping to make sense of the puzzle.
     
The novel then shifts back in time to 1865, and follows the events leading up to the night of January 27th, 1866, when all the mysteries converge. The main plot revolves around the relationship between Anna Wetherell and Emery Staines, who fall in love at first sight but are separated by a series of obstacles and manipulations. The main antagonist is Francis Carver, a ruthless sea captain who has a vendetta against Staines and who schemes to ruin his life and fortune. Carver is aided by Lydia Wells, Crosbie's widow and a cunning fortune-teller who poses as Emery's friend. Lydia also has an affair with Alistair Lauderback, a politician who owns the ship Godspeed that brought Moody and Carver to Hokitika.
     
The novel also explores the social and political issues of the time, such as the tensions between the Maori and the Pakeha (European settlers), the racism and violence against the Chinese immigrants, the corruption and greed of the gold rush, and the role of women in a patriarchal society. The novel also incorporates elements of magic realism, such as ghosts, visions, and astrological influences.
     
## Astrological Structure
     
The novel's structure is based on the system of Western astrology. Each of the twelve men corresponds to one of the twelve signs of the zodiac: Frost is Aries, Clinch is Taurus, Lowenthal is Gemini, Devlin is Cancer, Sook is Leo, Gascoigne is Virgo, Pritchard is Libra, Balfour is Scorpio, Nilssen is Sagittarius, Mannering is Capricorn, Quee Long is Aquarius, and Tauwhare is Pisces. Each chapter begins with an astrological chart that shows the positions of the planets and stars at that moment in time. The planets represent another set of characters: Moody is Mercury, Anna is Venus, Staines is Mars, Lydia is Jupiter,

Carver is Saturn, Lauderback is Uranus (or Herschel), Crosbie Wells is Neptune (or Leverrier), George Shepard (a police sergeant) is Pluto (or Adams), and Ah Sook (a Chinese gold-digger) is Juno (or Hebe). The novel also follows the phases of the moon and its influence on human affairs.
     
The novel's structure also reflects its themes of fate and free will. The astrological charts suggest that there is a cosmic order and a predetermined destiny for each character, but the novel also shows how the characters exercise their agency and choices, and how they are affected by chance and coincidence. The novel also plays with the idea of storytelling and the role of the reader. The novel is divided into twelve parts, each corresponding to one of the zodiac signs. The first part is the longest, with 360 pages, and each subsequent part is half the length of the previous one, until the last part, which is only two pages long. This creates a sense of acceleration and urgency, as well as a challenge for the reader to fill in the gaps and make sense of the complex plot.

## Critical Reception
     
The Luminaries received widespread acclaim from critics and readers. It won the 2013 Booker Prize, making Catton the youngest ever winner of the prestigious award. It also won the 2013 Governor General's Literary Award for English-language fiction in Canada, where Catton was born. It was shortlisted for several other awards, such as the Walter Scott Prize for historical fiction, the Women's Prize for Fiction, and the International Dublin Literary Award. It was also adapted into a six-part television miniseries by BBC and TVNZ in 2020, starring Eve Hewson as Anna, Himesh Patel as Staines, Eva Green as Lydia, and Marton Csokas as Carver.
     
The novel was praised for its originality, ambition, and craftsmanship. Critics admired Catton's mastery of language, genre, and structure, as well as her ability to create a vivid and immersive world with richly drawn characters. Some critics also noted the novel's feminist and postcolonial perspectives, as well as its commentary on the nature of history and fiction. However, some critics also found the novel too long, too complex, or too detached. Some felt that the novel sacrificed emotional depth and character development for formal experimentation and intellectual games. Some also questioned the relevance and accuracy of the astrological framework.
     
## Conclusion
     
The Luminaries is a remarkable novel that showcases Eleanor Catton's talent and vision. It is a novel that challenges and rewards its readers with its intricate plot, its historical detail, its astrological symbolism, and its metafictional playfulness. It is a novel that explores the themes of love, justice, identity, and destiny in a turbulent and fascinating period of New Zealand's history.
